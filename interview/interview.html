          <p class="question">How does Virtual DOM work?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            Whenever a value changes, the entire UI component is re-rendered in
            the Virtual DOM. Then the difference between the previous and the
            new Virtual DOM is calculated. After that, only the changed values
            are updated in the real DOM.

            Shadow DOM is a browser feature used for scoping variables and CSS
            in web components, while Virtual DOM is a concept implemented in
            JavaScript libraries like React to optimize DOM updates.

            The state of the input is managed by the component's state, making
            it easy to access and manipulate input values.
